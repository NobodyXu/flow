# Welcome!

Welcome to the guide to my project called `flow`

`flow` is a system for defining and running parallel, data-dependency-driven 'programs'.
 
 The project is in its early stages and the current implementation is being used by me as a way
 to clarify my ideas and also as a way to continue to learn rust.
 
 Learn more about what it is and why I created it by reading the next (Introduction) section, 
 or dive right in and see if you can understand [Your First Flow](first_flow/first_flow.md)
 with zero previous knowledge and just your programmer's intuition.
 
 You can view the projects main [README.md](../README.md) also.
