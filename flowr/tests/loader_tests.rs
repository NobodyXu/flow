/// flowrlib integration tests
///
/// These tests are in flowr and not flowrlib as we want to keep flowrlib free of anything that
/// prevents it from being compiled to wasm32 for use in a browser or other wasm environment.
///
/// These tests use pre-written files on the file system and use filesystem
/// io to read them, which cannot be compiled to wasm, as no such concept (as stdio) exists in a
/// generic wasm execution environment.
///
/// They could be written as pure code (not reading files) and hence in flowclib, but that's quite
/// a lot of work to construct each flow in code, and so for now I've taken the easy route to write
/// some test flow toml files and just compile those. Plus that also stresses the deserialization
/// and parsing.
///
/// An interim solution could be so have the files in the code as Strings and parse from there.
