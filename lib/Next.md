Check connections all match up in type and direction.

Maybe add references to values and functions in the connections when we are doing that

Create a flat connection table with all connections in it

Reduce it down to connections between values and functions only.

Then create table of values and table of functions

Using connections, for each output, add a reference to one or more input that data should be sent to when made available.



Dumping
See if we can use json, yaml or some other serde output format to do the entire dumping for us,
avoiding all that display mess.
