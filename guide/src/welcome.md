# Hello

Welcome to my guide to my pet project 'flow'

`flow` is a system for defining and running parallel, data-dependency driven 'programs'.
 
 The project is in early stages and the current implementation is being used by me as a way
 to clarify my ideas and to continue to learn rust and other modern programming languages and tools.
 
 Learn more about what it is and why I created it by reading the introduction section, 
 or dive right in and see if you can understand your first 'flow' with zero previous knowledge
 and just your programmer's intuition.
