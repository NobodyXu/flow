## The Inspirations for 'flow'
I have had many sources of inspiration in this area over the past three decades, and without realizing it they started to coallesc 
in my head and seemingly unrelated ideas from very different projects started to come together to form what I eventually called 'flow'
and started to work on.

I will describe the specific inspirations in more detail in later sections of this guide.

The impetus to actually implement something, instead of just thinking about it, came over a year ago as a way to learn 
some rust (and later adding WebAssembly to the mix).

* The Inmos transputer chip and it's Occam parallel programming language (which I studied at Univerity in the '80's)
* Structured Analysis (and Design) from my work with it in HP the '80s!
* UNIX pipes
* Trace based compiler instruction scheduling work done at MultiFlow and later HP by Josh Fisher, Paolo Faraboschi and others
* Amoeba distributed OS by Andrew Tannenbaum that made a collaborating network of computers appear as one to the user of a "Workstation"
* Yahoo! Pipes
