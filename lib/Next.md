Check connections all match up in direction.

Maybe add references to values and functions in the connections when we are doing that

Use a hash table by route or name to find IO values, and not have to iterate through them?

Create a flat connection table with all connections in it

Reduce it down to connections between values and functions only.

Then create table of values and table of functions

Using connections, for each output, add a reference to one or more input that data should be sent to when made available.
