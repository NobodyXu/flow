# `flowr`

See also: [Code docs](../code/doc/flowr/index.html)

`flowr` is a native runtime for flows build using the `flowrlib` library.

It handles the execution of `Functions` forming a `Flow` according to the defined semantics.

## Runtime functions
Additionally, it provides the required runtime functions to flows to help them interact with the environment they run in.

See the [Code docs](../code/doc/flowr/index.html) for more details on those runtime functions.
