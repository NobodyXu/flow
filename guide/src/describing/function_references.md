## Function Reference
A reference to a function defined in another file or in a library:
* `alias` - the name of the function
* `source` - the source of where the function is defined. This can either be a file on the local file system, or a url, or a reference to a library function. If no scheme is specified a local file
is assumed. Valid schemes are "file:", "http:", "https:" or the custom "lib:".
